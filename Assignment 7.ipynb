    "2. Why do raw strings often appear in Regex objects?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans - Raw strings are used so that backslashes do not have to be escaped.Since regular expressions frequently use backslashes in them, it is convenient to pass raw strings to the re.compile() function instead of typing extra backslashes.\n"
